project brief description:

This is a Recency, Frequency, Monetary customer segmentation model i built using python for clustering retailor customers. 
A csv file containing 3 columns need to be created beforehand in order to generate result. 

csv file description: column1 is recency(how many days passed since the customer purchased); column2 is customer id 
(c_id in the codes); column3 is customer purchased amount in monetary value; The first row must be heading, followed by 
actual data. You can enter whatever heading you prefer to the csv file 1st row.(eg:recency, customer_id, purchase_amount) 
However, the order must be recency, c_id, and amount. 

About output: plot output is a bar chart with x-axis for different type of customers (111,112,113,121,122,123,211...), y-axis is 
the frequency of a particular type of customer. A segmentation of "331" means customer who shopped not long ago, fequently 
shopped at the store but with low purchase amount. For detailed explanation about RFM model please refer to

This customer segmentation chart can be used to see which type of customer a retailor had and what can be done to 
perform up-sell, cross-sell, or customer re-activation to different customers.
Other outputs are three csv files whith name customer_churn, customer_upsell, and customer_best. 

Till now, the max dataset i tried contained 35,000 transactions with 1,200 customers. It took about 10 min to run the code. 

Further analysis can be done using association rules to find what products to promote to certain customers. In order to 
achieve that, dataset containing detailed purchasing information (i.e. item number, item name) is required.
